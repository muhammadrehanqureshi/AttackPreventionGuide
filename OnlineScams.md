# Avoiding Online Scams: Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Schemes

## Types of Online Scams

1. **Phishing Scams**: Attackers send fake emails or messages pretending to be a legitimate entity (e.g., a bank or government agency) in order to steal personal information like login credentials or financial data.
2. **Tech Support Scams**: Fraudsters claim to be from a well-known company (e.g., Microsoft) and tell you that your computer is infected with a virus. They then ask for remote access to your system or request payment for unnecessary services.
3. **Online Shopping Scams**: Fake e-commerce sites offer products at unbeatable prices, often leading to payment theft or delivery of counterfeit items.
4. **Investment Scams**: Fraudulent schemes that promise high returns on investments (e.g., cryptocurrency scams, Ponzi schemes) to trick people into sending money.
5. **Romance Scams**: Scammers build fake online relationships with victims and ask for money under false pretenses.
6. **OTP (One-Time Password) Frauds**: Attackers try to trick victims into revealing OTPs sent to their phones or emails. Fraudsters often impersonate banks or service providers and convince victims to share OTPs to gain unauthorized access to their accounts.

## How to Protect Yourself from Online Scams

1. **Be Cautious of Unsolicited Offers**: Always be suspicious of unsolicited emails, phone calls, or messages that offer something "too good to be true." Scammers often use urgent language to pressure you into acting quickly.
2. **Verify Sources**: Check the legitimacy of emails, messages, or websites before sharing any personal information. Look for signs of authenticity (e.g., official domain names, proper contact details).
3. **Use Strong Passwords and 2FA**: Secure your online accounts with strong passwords and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to protect your sensitive data from unauthorized access.
4. **Avoid Sending Money to Strangers**: Never send money or provide financial information to someone you haven't met in person, especially if you have only interacted online.
5. **Check for Secure Websites**: When making online purchases or entering personal information, ensure the website uses HTTPS (secure) in the URL.
6. **Do Not Share OTPs**: Never share One-Time Passwords (OTPs) with anyone, even if they claim to be from your bank or service provider. Legitimate companies will never ask you to share your OTP over the phone or email.
