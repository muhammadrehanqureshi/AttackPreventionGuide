# Phishing: What It Is and How to Protect Yourself

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to trick you into revealing personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. This is usually done via email, social media, or fake websites.

## Common Types of Phishing

- **Email Phishing**: Fake emails that look like they come from legitimate sources, such as banks or social media sites, asking you to click on a link and provide sensitive information.
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals or organizations, often with personalized information to make it appear more legitimate.
- **Smishing**: Phishing attempts made via SMS or text messages.
- **Vishing**: Voice phishing attempts, typically over the phone, where attackers impersonate trusted organizations.

## How to Protect Yourself from Phishing

1. **Be Cautious of Unsolicited Emails**: Don't click on links or open attachments from unknown senders.
2. **Check the URL**: Ensure that the website you’re visiting is legitimate. Look for "https://" in the URL and verify the domain.
3. **Look for Typos**: Phishing emails often contain spelling or grammar mistakes.
4. **Verify Requests for Personal Information**: Legitimate companies will never ask for sensitive information via email or text.
5. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Even if attackers steal your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the second authentication factor.
