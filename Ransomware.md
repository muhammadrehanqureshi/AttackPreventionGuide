# Ransomware: What It Is and How to Protect Yourself

## What is Ransomware?

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that locks or encrypts your files and demands a ransom (payment) in exchange for the decryption key or to regain access to your files. Ransomware can infect your computer through email attachments, malicious websites, or compromised software.

## How Does Ransomware Work?

1. **Infection**: Ransomware often spreads through phishing emails or malicious links that download the malware onto your device.
2. **Locking Files**: Once installed, ransomware encrypts your files and displays a ransom note with instructions on how to pay the attacker.
3. **Payment**: If you pay the ransom, thereâ€™s no guarantee that the attacker will decrypt your files or return access to them.

## How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware

1. **Backup Your Files Regularly**: Use an external hard drive or cloud storage to keep up-to-date backups of your important files.
2. **Use Strong Security Software**: Install antivirus software and keep it updated to detect and prevent ransomware attacks.
3. **Avoid Suspicious Links and Attachments**: Do not click on links or open attachments from unknown senders or untrusted sources.
4. **Enable Firewall Protection**: A properly configured firewall can help block malicious traffic and prevent ransomware from entering your system.
5. **Update Your Software**: Keep your operating system and software up to date to fix vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.
6. **Do Not Pay the Ransom**: Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the attacker will decrypt your files. It's better to restore files from backups.
