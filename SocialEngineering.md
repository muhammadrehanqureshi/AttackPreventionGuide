# Social Engineering: Understanding and Protecting Against Manipulation

## What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is a technique used by attackers to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. It often involves psychological manipulation rather than technical hacking.

## Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

1. **Phishing**: Attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate sources in order to steal personal information like passwords or credit card numbers.
2. **Pretexting**: The attacker pretends to be someone you trust (e.g., a bank official or tech support) and creates a fabricated scenario to gain access to your personal information.
3. **Baiting**: Involves offering something enticing (e.g., free software, gifts) to lure victims into providing personal information or downloading malicious files.
4. **Tailgating**: The attacker attempts to gain physical access to a restricted area by following authorized personnel without permission.

## How to Protect Yourself from Social Engineering Attacks

1. **Be Skeptical**: Always question unsolicited emails, phone calls, or messages asking for sensitive information.
2. **Verify Requests**: Contact the individual or organization directly using known contact information to verify any suspicious requests.
3. **Use Strong Authentication**: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts to provide an additional layer of security.
4. **Educate Yourself and Others**: Regularly update yourself on common social engineering tactics and share this knowledge with others.
