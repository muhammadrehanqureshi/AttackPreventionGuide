# Public Wi-Fi Security: How to Protect Yourself on Unsecured Networks

## The Risks of Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks (e.g., in cafes, airports, hotels) are often unsecured, making it easy for attackers to intercept your data. Risks include:

1. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Attackers can intercept communications between you and the website or app you're using.
2. **Eavesdropping**: Attackers can listen in on your internet activity and steal personal information like passwords, credit card numbers, and emails.
3. **Fake Wi-Fi Networks**: Attackers can set up rogue networks that appear to be legitimate, luring users to connect and then stealing data.

## How to Protect Yourself on Public Wi-Fi

1. **Avoid Sensitive Transactions**: Avoid accessing sensitive information like banking details or personal emails while on public Wi-Fi.
2. **Use a VPN**: A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet connection, making it much harder for attackers to intercept your data.
3. **Use HTTPS Websites**: Ensure websites you visit use HTTPS (the "s" stands for secure) to encrypt your connection and protect your data.
4. **Turn Off File Sharing**: Disable file sharing settings on your device to prevent unauthorized access to your files.
5. **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable 2FA on your accounts to add an extra layer of protection, in case your credentials are compromised.
